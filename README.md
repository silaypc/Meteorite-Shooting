of "e", "n", or "h" for the player to be able to choose the difficulty level. The angle of the player character can be seen next to it. The angles
on top of the targets are randomized different colors. There is an ammo counter at the top of the screen which changes color according to how much you've
got left. The meteorites have health that is displayed on top of them and it increases the harder the game mode is. The speed of the meteorites
change according to the game mode you are in. Also it affects the size of the meteroites, so hard mode will have the largest meteroites whereas
easy mode meteorites are small. The speed of the meteorites change accordingly, easy mode has the slowest while hard mode has the fastest meteorites.
